# SmithWissehFinalProject

We have decided to recreate the game "Clue" by implementing different data into the Main class. 
The suspects, weapons, and the rooms not only need to be initialized, but randomized for future games. 
If coded correctly, only through one scenario should the game be won. 
This would require the program to acknowledge a clue (when found) and how it affects the rest of the variables within the game. 
Furthermore, the playability relies on how the game would advance when more evidence is accumulated.
